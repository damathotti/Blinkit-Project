Welcome to **Blinkit-Project**! 🎉 This project is dedicated to delivering a comprehensive analysis of **Blinkit's** sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. By leveraging the power of **Power BI** and key performance indicators (KPIs), we extract meaningful insights that help drive decision-making and enhance operational efficiency.

## 📋 Business Requirements

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a detailed analysis of Blinkit’s operations, leveraging relevant data metrics. This includes evaluating sales, customer feedback, and inventory distribution across multiple categories. Our goal is to uncover valuable insights and pinpoint optimization opportunities. The project utilizes **Power BI** to visually represent this data through **interactive dashboards and charts**.

## 📈 Charting Requirements & Insights

To visualize these KPIs effectively, we created the following charts to offer a deeper understanding of Blinkit's sales and performance across various dimensions:

### 1. **Total Sales by Fat Content** 🍔
- **Objective**: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
- **KPI Insights**: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
- **Chart Type**: **Donut Chart**

   This chart helps reveal whether fat content plays a significant role in Blinkit’s overall sales. It allows decision-makers to adjust marketing strategies and product offerings based on this insight.

### 2. **Total Sales by Item Type** 🥡
- **Objective**: Identify which item types contribute the most to total sales.
- **KPI Insights**: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with different item types.
- **Chart Type**: **Bar Chart**

   This bar chart highlights the performance of various product categories. It provides a clear view of which items are driving Blinkit’s sales, helping to refine the product portfolio.

### 3. **Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales** 🍔🏬
- **Objective**: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
- **KPI Insights**: Evaluate how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content across outlets.
- **Chart Type**: **Stacked Column Chart**

   This visualization allows us to understand the performance of outlets by fat content, offering insights into regional preferences and how fat content influences total sales across different locations.

### 4. **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment** 🏪
- **Objective**: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
- **Chart Type**: **Line Chart**

   The line chart offers a dynamic view of how different outlet establishments (new vs. old) impact total sales, helping Blinkit assess the effectiveness of their physical locations.

### 5. **Sales by Outlet Size** 📏
- **Objective**: Analyze the correlation between outlet size and total sales.
- **Chart Type**: **Donut/Pie Chart**

   This donut/pie chart helps visualize how the size of an outlet (small, medium, large) influences sales, aiding Blinkit in optimizing outlet operations.

### 6. **Sales by Outlet Location** 🌍
- **Objective**: Assess the geographic distribution of sales across different locations.
- **Chart Type**: **Funnel Map**

   The funnel map provides a geographic view of Blinkit’s sales performance, helping the team understand which regions are performing best and where there may be untapped opportunities.

### 7. **All Metrics by Outlet Type** 🏪📊
- **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating) broken down by outlet types.
- **Chart Type**: **Matrix Card**

   The matrix card offers a snapshot of how different outlet types (e.g., retail, online, hybrid) compare across all major KPIs, enabling Blinkit to optimize sales strategies based on outlet-specific performance.
